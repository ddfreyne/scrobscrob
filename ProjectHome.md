ScrobScrob is a very lightweight 'scrobbler' for AudioScrobbler/Last.fm.

Its design goals are:

  * Unobtrusive interface. The interface will only provide basic functionality, and will stay hidden most of the time.
  * No advanced features. You can't love/hate/tag/recommend songsâ€”use the Last.fm site instead.
